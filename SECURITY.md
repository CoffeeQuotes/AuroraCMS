## Reporting a Vulnerability
Reporting is pretty easy, just open an Issue with an explanation with as much detail you are technically able to provide, screenshots, logs (truncated to the actual problem so we don't have to read through unnecessary information).

Information that will help us to rectify and duplicate issues:
- Operating System that the CMS is hosted on.
- PHP and SQL Versions.
- Operating System that the CMS is being viewed by on the Client Side.
- Browsers affected by the issue/s.
- Screenshots showing the output of the area (cropped to the information is fine).
- Server logs that describe the errors (truncated to show the relevant information).
