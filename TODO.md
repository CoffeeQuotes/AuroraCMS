This is a quick list of things what need to be fixed or worked on to help those contributing to know what features or bugs are needing to be worked on.

- Installation checks for cURL, and Zip, it was discovered that the updates were failing due to zip and cURL not being installed on some installations causing updates to fail but not reporting errors in logs
- Add clear table data when installing
- Administration
  - Option to Bundle Content into one area, rather than seperate paged areas.
  - Fix update core system
  - Add ability to upload and update themes
  - Fix Selected Administration Theme colour
  - Import Catalogue from CSV
  - Adjust Mobile Responsiveness
  - Fix views for Calendar which break when switching between Calendar and Table.
  - Possibility to include a Timeline View for Bookings and Scheduler.
  - Messages
    - Option to not send notification emails via contact form, or only after a set time period or when a set number of messages have been received (these will help reduce the amount of messages generated, as of now when a contact message is made via the contact form, a notification is sent to the site owner, an autoresponse notification is sent to the creator using the form, plus if the email is non-existent a bounce email is generated by the mail server).
    - Option to not autorespond to emails via contact form and only display an a response on the contact page.
    - Implement Javascript Client Side checkbox generator to fool spambots (not foolproof, this is similar to what the reCaptcha does, spam bots/users are passing this).
    - Restrict Message Senders to Country (also not foolproof as Bots can spoof local IP to the country they are spamming).
    - implement our own custom captcha (also not foolproof if used by a bot that can do OCR, or if the spammer is done by a person).
    - Separate the Form from the page, loading html containing the form once the page loads. (Need to check if bots can still see the form after being loaded).
    - Store a timestamp when rendering the page (not in the page), then compare the submitted time against the stored time, if it's too quick, say less than 10 seconds, then it's safe to bet that a bot submitted the form.
